# raspberry-pi5-object-detection
Real-time object detection on Raspberry Pi 5 using OpenCV with shapes detection (rectangle, square, circle).


A real-time object detection project built on **Raspberry Pi 5** using **OpenCV**. This project detects basic shapes like **rectangles, squares, and circles** using a **tablet as a webcam**. AI assistance was used to help write parts of the code, making development faster and more efficient.  

The demo video includes **Interstellar music**â€”because why not make coding cinematic? ðŸŽ¶

## Features
- Real-time detection of rectangles, squares, and circles
- Runs on Raspberry Pi 5 with Ubuntu 24.04
- OpenCV-based computer vision implementation
- AI-assisted coding for quicker development
- Tablet used as webcam input
- Demo video with cinematic music

## Setup Instructions
1. Install **Ubuntu 24.04** on your Raspberry Pi 5.
2. Install Python and required libraries:
  
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3-pip
   pip3 install opencv-python
Connect your tablet as a webcam using USB or IP camera app.

Run the Python script:


python3 object_detection.py
Watch your Pi detect shapes in real-time!

Future Improvements
